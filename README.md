# Profile Attribute To State Node

A simple authentication node for ForgeRock's [Identity Platform][forgerock_platform] 5.5 and above. This node can be used to pull information from a (previously identified in the authentication tree) user's profile into the shared authentication state for easy reference by subsequent nodes in the tree.

As values returned from a profile's attributes are returned as Sets, this node offers various ways to select the element(s) from that Set, determined by the choice of **selection type** parameter. 

These states operate as:

* **SelectExact** The object will be copied exactly as is (as a Set) into the shared state. Be careful that other nodes using this value expect this object to be a Set when reading and using it.
* **SelectFirst** The object's first value will be copied in (as a String) into the shared state. This is the default mode, and is likely the most useful for single-item attribute values.
* **SelectAsString** The entire object will be converted to a String, and the resulting String will be placed in the shared state. This mode may be useful for multi-value attributes, but caution should be used in subsequent nodes to understand the output format.

Configuration Screenshot

The above screenshot demonstrates the flexibility of authentication nodes by generating a very (VERY!) simple device fingerprinting journey using granular authentication nodes. By storing the user's current browser in the authentication shared state and comparing it against the previous browser used to authenticate as stored in the user's profile we are able to increase or decrease their authentication level, before storing the new previous browser value in the profile.

## Installation

Copy the .jar file from the ../target directory into the ../web-container/webapps/openam/WEB-INF/lib directory where AM is deployed.  Restart the web container to pick up the new node.  The node will then appear in the authentication trees components palette.
